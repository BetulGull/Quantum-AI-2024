To ensure a smooth and fair experience for all participants, please carefully read and adhere to the following rules and guidelines. These instructions aim to provide clarity and structure for the project period, from team formation to submission and final judgment.
If there are any questions, please get in touch with the Womanium team on the Womanium Discord server.

### Eligibility:
  1. To participate in the project, you must be successfully enrolled in the Womanium Quantum+AI 2024 program. 
   - Registration link: [https://lu.ma/WQ-2024](https://lu.ma/WQ-2024)
   - Webpage: [https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI](https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI)
  2. All nationalities, genders, and age groups are welcome to participate in the projects. 

### Project Browsing and Selection:
  1. Review all available projects listed below.
  2. Visit each project's repository for a detailed explanation. Each project has unique deliverables and guidelines for successful submission; please read these carefully before selecting a project.

### Team Formation:
  1. Network with fellow participants during the Womanium Team-building events over Zoom and on Discord to find your perfect team.
  2. Each project has a unique maximum team size; please read carefully before forming your teams.
  3. Finalize your team and select the project you want to work on by **July 5, 2024**.
  4. Register your team and project on the Canvas Module _"8. Womanium Quantum+AI Projects"_.

Instructions for each team:
  1. Browse through all the projects (given below). 
  2. Visit the project repositories for a detailed explanation. Each project has a different set of team guidelines for successful submission. Please read carefully before selecting the project to work on.
  3. Network with fellow participants during the Womanium Team-building events over Zoom and on Discord to find your perfect team.
  4. Finalise your team and the project you want to on by **July 5, 2024**
  5. Fork/duplicate the project repository of your choice (for the purposes of these instructions, this forked/duplicated repository will be referred to as your “team repository”). 
  6. Work on your team repository during the project period (**July 5, 2024 - August 5, 2024**). Your repository has to be made public at the time of the submission for us to be able to judge your solutions. All work inside your team repository will be considered as the final submission for the project.
  7. Submission deadline: **August 5, 2024, 23:59pm US ET**.
Add the GitHub submission link (public link of your forked repo) on Canvas to be eligible for a Certificate.
  8. Please do not modify your team repository between the Judging period (**August 5, 2024 - August 14, 2024**). If you modify your team repository during this period, your submission may be subject to disqualification.
  9. Project finalists, shortlisted to present their solutions on Demo Day, will be announced on **August 10, 2024**.
  10. Project winners will be announced on Demo Day, **August 14, 2024**.
  11. Project winners will qualify for QSL Fellowships, starting **September 1, 2024**.

## What should your Team Repository contain?
  1. Name of the team.
  2. Name of all team members, along with their Discord ID, Github ID, Nationality, Current Affiliation and contact email.
  3. Name of the Project.
  4. A comprehensive ReadMe file which contains all the important information about your project solution.
  6. All necessary code files and any other information you feel is required to judge your project solution. (Scoring rubric can be found in the respective project repositories.)
  7. Remember to submit your Team repository by creating a fork only to the project repository you are working on. Final Team repositories must be made public and submitted by August 5, 2024, 23:59pm US ET. Each team member needs to add the Github submission link (public link of your forked repo) on Canvas to be eligible for a Certificate.
_Make sure your repo does NOT contain any personal or team's tokens/access information to access backends._  
  
## Womanium QSL Projects:
  ### 1. Quantum Chemistry Simulation for Environmental Modeling --> *by Naval Nuclear Laboratory*
  https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI
  > (Team Size = max.4).  Participants will apply classical and quantum chemistry simulation techniques to model climate and environmental scenarios, bridging theoretical quantum chemistry with real-world applications.
  ### 2. Development of Novel Quantum Algorithms --> *by Classiq*
  https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI
  > Participants will delve into quantum algorithms offering exponential advantages, such as Shor’s algorithm, HHL and Hamiltonian simulation, and learn their practical applications through state-of-the-art implementations.
  ### 3. Quantum Machine Learning for Conspicuity Detection in Production --> *by Fraunhofer ITWM*
  https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI
  > This project focuses on optimizing production processes by identifying improvement measures early. Participants will explore hybrid quantum computing to accelerate data analysis, with training on QML, hybrid models, QNNs.
