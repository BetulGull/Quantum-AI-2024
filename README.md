  4. Outstanding participants will win QSL Fellowships, starting September 1, 2024.

  
## Womanium QSL Projects:
  ### 1. Quantum Chemistry Simulation for Environmental Modeling --> *by Naval Nuclear Laboratory*
  https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI
  > (Team Size = max.4).  Participants will apply classical and quantum chemistry simulation techniques to model climate and environmental scenarios, bridging theoretical quantum chemistry with real-world applications.
  ### 2. Development of Novel Quantum Algorithms --> *by Classiq*
  https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI
  > Participants will delve into quantum algorithms offering exponential advantages, such as Shorâ€™s algorithm, HHL and Hamiltonian simulation, and learn their practical applications through state-of-the-art implementations.
  ### 3. Quantum Machine Learning for Conspicuity Detection in Production --> *by Fraunhofer ITWM*
  https://womanium.org/Quantum/AI
  > This project focuses on optimizing production processes by identifying improvement measures early. Participants will explore hybrid quantum computing to accelerate data analysis, with training on QML, hybrid models, QNNs.


## Code of Conduct
  - Maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct throughout the project period. Any form of cheating, harassment, or misconduct will lead to disqualification and potential banning from future events. Maintain professionalism and respect in all interactions with fellow participants and the Womanium team.
