# Quantum-AI-2024
Womanium Quantum+AI 2024 Projects

## Instructions:
Instructions for each team:
  1. Browse through all the projects (given below). 
  2. Visit the project repositories for a detailed explanation. Each project has a different set of team guidelines for successful submission. Please read carefully before selecting the project to work on.
  3. Network with fellow participants during the Womanium Team-building events over Zoom and on Discord to find your perfect team.
  4. Finalise your team and the project you want to on by **July 5, 2024**
  5. Fork/duplicate the project repository of your choice (for the purposes of these instructions, this forked/duplicated repository will be referred to as your “team repository”). 
  6. Work on your team repository during the project period (**July 5, 2024 - August 5, 2024**). Your repository has to be made public at the time of the submission for us to be able to judge your solutions. All work inside your team repository will be considered as the final submission for the project.
  7. Submission deadline: **August 5, 2024, 23:59pm US ET**.
Add the GitHub submission link (public link of your forked repo) on Canvas to be eligible for a Certificate.
  8. Please do not modify your team repository between the Judging period (**August 5, 2024 - August 14, 2024**). If you modify your team repository during this period, your submission may be subject to disqualification.
  9. Project finalists, shortlisted to present their solutions on Demo Day, will be announced on **August 10, 2024**.
  10. Project winners will be announced on Demo Day, **August 14, 2024, 2024**.
  11. Project winners will qualify for QSL Fellowships, starting **September 1, 2024**.

## What should your Team Repository contain?
  1. Name of the team.
  2. Name of all team members, along with their Discord ID, Github ID, Nationality, Current Affiliation and contact email.
  3. Name of the Project.
  4. A comprehensive ReadMe file which contains all the important information about your project solution.
  6. All necessary code files and any other information you feel is required to judge your project solution. (Scoring rubric can be found in the respective project repositories.)
  7. Remember to submit your Team repository by creating a fork only to the project repository you are working on. Final Team repositories must be made public and submitted by August 5, 2024, 23:59pm US ET. Each team member needs to add the Github submission link (public link of your forked repo) on Canvas to be eligible for a Certificate.
_Make sure your repo does NOT contain any personal or team's tokens/access information to access backends._  
  
## Womanium QSL Projects:
  ### 1. Quantum Hardware Education Challenge --> *by Naval Nuclear Laboratory*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-Hardware-Education-Challenge---QWorld
  > Develop an interactive quantum hardware module for QWorld! QWorld currently offers the comprehensive Quantum Programming modules QBronze, QSilver and QNickel. In this challenge, you will expand the QWorld curriculum with an exciting interactive module on a hardware implementation of your choice: from superconducting qubits and Qiskit Metal to topological quantum computing.
  ### 2. Green Qupermarket (Quantum Focus) --> *by Classiq*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Green-Qupermarket-Technical-Focus---Deloitte
  > The goal of the Green Qupermarket challenge is to analyze how quantum technology can optimize the energy consumption model of supermarkets in regard to its CO2 emissions. The challenge scenario features a supermarket, multiple electric vehicles, and various weather conditions. The energy management of the supermarket is to be optimized so that the total CO2 emission is minimal by using the green decentrally generated energy out of electric vehicles. The batteries of the electric vehicles can be used as additional storage capacity. Create a quantum algorithm, a quantum hybrid solution or a quantum inspired solution addressing the optimization of the utilization of electricity with respect to a minimum CO2 emission.
  ### 3. Green Qupermarket (Business Focus) --> *by Fraunhofer ITWM*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Green-Qupermarket-Business-Focus---Deloitte
  > The goal of the Green Qupermarket challenge is to analyze how quantum technology can optimize the energy consumption model of supermarkets in regard to its CO2 emissions. The challenge scenario features a supermarket, multiple electric vehicles, and various weather conditions. The energy management of the supermarket is to be optimized so that the total CO2 emission is minimal by using the green decentrally generated energy out of electric vehicles. The batteries of the electric vehicles can be used as additional storage capacity. Develop a price model for charging and discharging of electric vehicles taking into account  CO2 emissions and dependency of demand and supply on weather conditions, and develop a corresponding business model.
