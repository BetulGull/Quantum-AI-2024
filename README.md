# Quantum-AI-2024
Womanium Quantum+AI 2024 Projects

## Instructions:
Instructions for each team (1 to 6 people):
  1. Browse through all the challenges (given below), to get an overview on each Hackathon challenge.
  2. Visit the challenge repositories for detailed explaination of the challenges.
  3. Network with fellow participants during the Womanium Team-building events over Zoom and on Discord to find your perfect team.
  4. Finalise your team and the challenge you want to work during the Hackathon. Submit the Team & Challenge Registration Form (see link on Discord) by **August 5th 2022**
  5. Fork/duplicate the challenge repository of your choice (for the purposes of these instructions, this forked/duplicated repository will be referred to as your “team repository”). 
  6. Work on your team repository during the Hack period (**August 8th 2022 - August 23rd 2022**). Your repository has to be made public at the time of the Hackathon end for us to be able to judge your solutions. All work inside your team repository will be considered as the final submission for this hackathon.
  7. Submission deadline: **August 23rd 2022, 23:59pm US ET**.
Add the Github submission link (public link of your forked repo) on Canvas to be eligible for a Certificate: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/4914757/quizzes/11797400
  8. Please do not modify your team repository between the Judging period (**August 24th 2022 - August 25th 2022**). If you modify your team repository during this period, your submission may be subject to disqualification.
  9. All results will be announced on Demo Day, **August 25th 2022, 11am-1:30pm US ET**.

## What should your Team Repository contain?
  1. Name of the team.
  2. Name of all team members, along with their Discord ID, Github ID, and contact email.
  3. Name of the Pitch Presenter on Demo Day.
  4. Name of the Challenge.
  5. A comprehensive ReadMe file which contains all the important information about your hack solution.
  6. All necessary code files, pitch deck and any other information you feel is required to judge your challenge solution. (Scoring rubric can be found in the information document you received by email and on Discord.)
  7. Remember to submit your Team repository by creating a fork only to the challenge repository you are working on. Final Team repositories must be made public and submitted by August 23rd 2022, 23:59pm US ET. Each team member needs to add the Github submission link (public link of your forked repo) on Canvas to be eligible for a Certificate: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/4914757/quizzes/11797400
_Make sure your repo does NOT contain any personal or team's tokens/access information to access backends._  
  
## Hackathon Challenges:
  ### 1. Quantum Hardware Education Challenge --> *by QWorld*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-Hardware-Education-Challenge---QWorld
  > Develop an interactive quantum hardware module for QWorld! QWorld currently offers the comprehensive Quantum Programming modules QBronze, QSilver and QNickel. In this challenge, you will expand the QWorld curriculum with an exciting interactive module on a hardware implementation of your choice: from superconducting qubits and Qiskit Metal to topological quantum computing.
  ### 2. Green Qupermarket (Quantum Focus) --> *by Deloitte*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Green-Qupermarket-Technical-Focus---Deloitte
  > The goal of the Green Qupermarket challenge is to analyze how quantum technology can optimize the energy consumption model of supermarkets in regard to its CO2 emissions. The challenge scenario features a supermarket, multiple electric vehicles, and various weather conditions. The energy management of the supermarket is to be optimized so that the total CO2 emission is minimal by using the green decentrally generated energy out of electric vehicles. The batteries of the electric vehicles can be used as additional storage capacity. Create a quantum algorithm, a quantum hybrid solution or a quantum inspired solution addressing the optimization of the utilization of electricity with respect to a minimum CO2 emission.
  ### 3. Green Qupermarket (Business Focus) --> *by Deloitte*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Green-Qupermarket-Business-Focus---Deloitte
  > The goal of the Green Qupermarket challenge is to analyze how quantum technology can optimize the energy consumption model of supermarkets in regard to its CO2 emissions. The challenge scenario features a supermarket, multiple electric vehicles, and various weather conditions. The energy management of the supermarket is to be optimized so that the total CO2 emission is minimal by using the green decentrally generated energy out of electric vehicles. The batteries of the electric vehicles can be used as additional storage capacity. Develop a price model for charging and discharging of electric vehicles taking into account  CO2 emissions and dependency of demand and supply on weather conditions, and develop a corresponding business model.
